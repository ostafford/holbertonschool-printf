# _printf

## main.h:
- Contains all function prototypes
- Includes necessary header files
- Helper functions (`handle_print`, `print_char`, `print_string`, `print_percent`, `print_int`, `print_digit`) handle specific types of format specifiers and their corresponding arguments.

<details>
  <summary>Function Prototype Explanation</summary>

```c
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
/* 
 * - 'const char *format'   -> A constant character pointer to the format string
 * - '...'                  -> A variadic parameter allowing multiple arguments
 */

int handle_print(const char *format, int *i, va_list list);
/*
 * 'const char *format' -> Pointer to the format string
 * '*i'                 -> Pointer to the current index being processed in the format string
 * 'va_list list'       -> holding the variadic arguments (multiple arguments) that are passed to _printf
 */

int print_char(va_list types);
/*
 * 'types' -> A list containing the character to print.
 */

int print_string(va_list types);
/* 
 * 'va_list types' -> A list containing the string to print.
 */

int print_percent(void);
/* 
 * 'void' -> Prints the '%' character itself. This is used when the format string contains %%
 */

int print_int(va_list types);
/* 
 * 'va_list types' -> A list containing the integer to print.
 */

int print_digit(int d);
/* 
 * 'int d' -> The digit to print as an integer (0-9)
 */
```

## _putchar.c:

- Contains the implementation of _putchar function
- Uses `write` system call to output characters (`unistd.h`)

<details>
    <summary>Function Explanation</summary>

```c
int _putchar(char c)
/* 
 * 'int'      -> This is the return type, indicating the function will return an integer.
 * '_putchar' -> The name of the function (you can call it anything you want, but '_putchar' is conventional for this purpose).
 * '(char c)' -> The parameter 'c', of type 'char', representing the character to print.
 *               (You can choose a different name for the parameter, but 'c' is short and common for this use.)
 */
{
return (write(1, &c, 1));
/*
 * 'return' ->  Returns (does not print) the result of the 'write' call.
 *              - If successful, it returns '1' (1 character written).
 *              - If an error occurs, it returns '-1'.
 * 'write'  ->  A system call that writes data directly to a file descriptor.
 *              (What's a 'file descriptor'? Think of it as a sticky note where the number
 *              identifies a specific file or output device.)
 * '1'      ->  Represents the file descriptor for standard output ('stdout').
 * '&c'     ->  A 'pointer' to the memory location of the character 'c'.
 * '1'      ->  The number of bytes to write. Since a 'char' is 1 byte, this specifies
 *              writing exactly 1 character.
 */
}

```
</details>

## _printf.c:

- The function loops through `format` one character at a time.
- If it encounters a regular character (not `%`), it prints it directly.
- When `%` is found, the function looks at the next character to determine the format specifier
- Once specifier is confirmed the `handle_print` will be called to print the argment.

## handle_print.c:

## print_functions.c:

- Contains individual functions for printing different types
- Each function `print_char` `print_string` `print_percent` handles a specific format specifier (c, s, %)
- These functions use a helper function `_putchar` to write characters to the standard output,\
    and they support formatted output similar to the behavior of the `printf` function in C.

- print_int(): Gets an integer argument from va_list and passes it to print_number

    - Returns count of characters printed
